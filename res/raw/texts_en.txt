Hello new Farmer!
Hi, I'm Farmer Jo! I heard you are here to rebuild the little farm of your grandfather? 
I know there is not much left, but I see your grandfather's ambition in your eyes. Let's grab your work boots and get started!
Plow fields!
First let me show you the farm basics on how to cultivate your land! Tap on the yard to plow your first field.
Plow more!
Wow, you also have your grandfather's talent! Let's plow 5 more fields!
Select crops!
Great! After we cultivated the land let's plant some crops on it. Tap on the empty field and plant wheat everywhere!
Boost your wheat!
Crops usually need time to grow. If you use your grandfather's secret diamond-fertilizer you can instantly harvest them.
Tap on a crop once to select it and then again to fertilize it with diamonds.
Harvest your wheat fields!
WOOOW! Did you see that! By boosting, all your crops are now fully grown! 
Tap on a crop to harvest one and then harvest all others.
4 more Wheat
Well done! Let's produce 4 more wheat to have a full storage and earn good money.
Let's plow, plant and harvest one more time together!
Check your storage!
Great, you are one kind of a great farmer!
Let's check your harvest in the storage to sell it and make some money. Just tap on the storage building to enter.
Sell crops from storage!
After some hard work it's always great to make some money!
Tap on the wheat to select it for sale. Then press "ALL" on the right side to select all wheat crops. When ready tap on "Sell".
First Money
Well done, well done! 
You can leave any building by tapping the "X" at the top right. Please do so.
Orders from others
By the way you get more money, if you produce crops or goods which someone asks you to produce. Let's check out, if there are any orders from other farmers.
Your first task
Ah, great! There is an order of wheat flour which you can see on the right side.  
This shouldn't be a problem to produce it! Let's close this window at the top right "X" and go to your mill.
Wind Mill & Flour
Please take these 4 wheat crops to produce some flour. 
Tap on your wind mill.
Enter production view!
Welcome to your wind mill.
Each building can produce 4 different goods. Let's produce wheat flour for now. Please select it.
Press produce
To produce flour you will need two wheat crops. If you miss any crops either harvest them or add them for diamonds.
Please produce 1x flour now and see how it is added to the production chain.
Task Completed!
Great! Congratulations! You just produced your first good out of crops! It is automatically put in your storage.
Let's hurry back to the orders to exchange the flour for your reward.
Collect your reward!
Deliver the order by tapping on the "Cash in" button. Doing tasks is more rewarding than selling stuff in the storage.
Please press the cash in button to receive the reward.
Becoming known!
Nicely done! People are already talking about your farm skills and want to give you a new task!
This time let's instantly finish this task for diamonds.
Fabulous
I knew that you could do it! Great!
Look, the Villagers want three eggs! I guess it's time to get some animals on your farm as well!
Please close this screen and go to the shop.
Enter the shop!
Press the lower right extend button to enter the shop.
Buildings
By leveling up you will be able to build many different enclosures and production buildings later on.
Let's build a chicken house.
Place a building on the yard!
This is the grid view which shows you the free spots where it's possible to place the chicken house. Please put it where you like.
Boost construction process!
Well done! Tap on the building to see when the building is finished. If you don't like to wait your can also boost it for a diamond.
Unwrap finished building!
Your building is done! Now tap on it to unwrap it!
Add animals to an enclosure!
Great, now let's add 1 of up to 4 chickens in this enclosure. 
Tap on a free spot in the enclosure in order to open the shop and choose a chicken.
Feed your animals!
Oh, no! Your chicken is hungry and will only produce eggs for you if it got feed. 
Feed it by taping on it.
Produce Food in your Feed Mill!
By visiting your feedmill you can produce food for your animals by using your stored crops. 
Crops become Food!
Usually you need to have crops in your storage to create food. This time I already put some corn in your storage to create food.
Well done!
Look at this! Your chicken is happy again and is producing an egg for you. 
To give it some company please add another chicken to the enclosure and feed it as well.
Your first egg!
Ah, look! Your first chicken has just produced it's first egg. Please tap on it to collect it. 
1 more egg!
Well done! Now let's also collect the other egg from your second chicken to complete the order.
My tip: If you don t want to wait later until an animal produces a good, you can also always boost it!
Cash in time!
Great, now you also know how to add, feed and collect goods from your animals. 
Let's complete the current order.
Tasks on your own
Well done my farm friend! More and more villagers are ordering from your farm!
Here are already more tasks to fulfill later!
Expand your Farm!
You almost know everything, but before you run short on space let's just expand your farm.
Congratulations!
Fantastic! You just earned your first reward! Just tap your farm house to collect an extra reward for this achievement!
Special Tasks!
Nice! Your farm house just improved! Mh, what's this? It's a truck from the nearby village with a special quests. If you complete it - you will earn a lot of farm cash!
Get a Special Task!
Tap on on the truck to open the quest window and accept it.
You can complete a truck order, once you have the required crops in your storage.
You made it!
Congratulations! You know now all the basics to fully rebuild the little farm of your grandfather!
